# University-Admission-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression

This project could be practically used to get the university acceptance rate for individual students using web application. In this hands-on project we will go through the following tasks: 
1) Understand the Problem Statement. 

2) Import libraries and datasets.

3) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

4) Perform Data Visualization.

5) Create Training and Testing Datasets.

6) Train and Evaluate a Linear Regression Model.

7) Train and Evaluate an Artificial Neural Network Model.

8) Train and Evaluate a Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Model.

9) Calculate and Print Regression model KPIs.
