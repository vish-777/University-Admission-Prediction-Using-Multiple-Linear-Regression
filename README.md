# University-Admission-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression

This project could be practically used to get the university acceptance rate for individual students using web application. In this hands-on project we will go through the following tasks: 

1) Import libraries and datasets.

2) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

3) Perform Data Visualization.

4) Create Training and Testing Datasets.

5) Train and Evaluate a Linear Regression Model.

6) Train and Evaluate an Artificial Neural Network Model.

7) Train and Evaluate a Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Model.

8) Calculate and Print Regression model KPIs.
